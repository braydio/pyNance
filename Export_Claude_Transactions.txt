> Why does the modal request return 0 transactions all the time? Is there an issue with the 
    formatting of the request of the modal component for the DailyNetIncome.vue and the 
    CategoryBreakdown.vue charts? They return such:
    XHRGET
    
  http://192.168.1.239:3353/api/transactions/get_transactions?start_date=2025-07-10&end_date=2025-0
    7-10
    [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 9ms]

        
    data    { total: 0, transactions: [] }
    total    0
    transactions    []
    status    "success"

  ● The API response indicates that no transactions are found for the specified date range. The 
  issue
     could be with how the modal component sends start_date and end_date. Verify if the dates are
    correctly formatted and within the range of available transactions. Also, check if the backend
    receives these parameters correctly and that they match the expected format. 
  So I am looking for how to construct the request from the frontend to:
  http://192.168.1.239:3353/api/transactions/get_transactions?start_date=2025-07-10&end_date=2025-0
  7-10 
  and to

● Check how the modal component constructs and formats start_date and end_date in the request.
  Verify if the dates are correctly set, matching existing transaction data. Also, ensure the
  backend receives these parameters in the correct format and that transactions exist within that
  range.

● Read(frontend/src/components/charts/CategoryBreakdownChart.vue)
  ⎿  Read 212 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The start_date and end_date are initialized and sent as ISO date strings in the
  RefreshPlaidControls.vue component: startDate is set to 30 days before today, and endDate is set
  to today, both formatted with toISOString().slice(0, 10). These dates should be correctly
  formatted in YYYY-MM-DD. Ensure the user selects or the code sets the date range correctly before
   making the request.

> No, I want the request made when the composable launches on bar click. Find that and you may `cat
   frontend/FrontendFilemap.local`

● I'll locate the part of the code where the request is made on bar click and then read the
  relevant file to review the request construction.

● Read(frontend/FrontendFilemap.local)
  ⎿  Read 155 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The request on bar click is constructed in useTransactions.js (likely inside composables). I'll
  read that file to confirm how start_date and end_date are sent.

● Read(frontend/composables/useTransactions.js)
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

● It seems useTransactions.js doesn't exist in the folder. It might be named differently or located
   elsewhere. I'll search for the function that handles the bar click request.

● Search(pattern: "fetchCategoryBreakdownTree")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● The request is made in /src/api/charts.js via the fetchCategoryBreakdownTree function. I'll
  review that file to see how it constructs the request.

● Read(frontend/src/api/charts.js)
  ⎿  Read 24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The fetchCategoryBreakdownTree function constructs the request by passing the params object
  directly as URL parameters via axios. The request URL is /api/charts/category_breakdown_tree with
   start_date and end_date included in params.

> Okay, now find the backend endpoint. Determine how it handles this call. Determine where errors 
  may be. You can use `cat backend/BackendFilemap.local`

● I'll read backend/BackendFilemap.local to locate the backend endpoint handling
  /api/charts/category_breakdown_tree and then analyze the code for potential issues.

● Read(backend/BackendFilemap.local)
  ⎿  Read 232 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The backend endpoint is likely in routes/charts.py given the URL path
  /api/charts/category_breakdown_tree. I'll review that file now.

● Read(backend/app/routes/charts.py)
  ⎿  Read 487 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The category_breakdown_tree() endpoint in routes/charts.py handles the request. It parses
  start_date and end_date from URL parameters, defaulting to last 30 days. It then queries
  transactions within that range. Check if the request parameters are correctly sent and parsed,
  and if actual transactions exist in the backend for that date range.

> The log returns the following: 
  025-08-03 03:32:29,305 - INFO - _internal.py:97 - 127.0.0.1 - - [03/Aug/2025 03:32:29] "GET 
  /api/transactions/get_transactions?start_date=2025-07-10&end_date=2025-07-10 HTTP/1.1" 200 - 

  But why doesn't it return any transactions? There should be several transactions for that date. 
  Review the specific file and determine how it is fetching the transactions.

● I'll review the /api/transactions/get_transactions endpoint implementation to determine how it
  fetches transactions and why it might return none. I will look into routes/transactions.py or
  similar files.

● Read(backend/app/routes/transactions.py)
  ⎿  Read 256 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The get_transactions_paginated() function in routes/transactions.py calls
  account_logic.get_paginated_transactions(). I will now review account_logic.py to see how it
  fetches transactions and if there might be a reason it returns nothing.

● Read(backend/app/sql/account_logic.py)
  ⎿  Read 748 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The function get_paginated_transactions() retrieves transactions between start_date and end_date
  from the database. If no transactions are returned for that date range, it could be due to the
  data not existing in the DB, or the date filters being incorrect or mismatched. Verify the date
  range used in your test matches existing data, and ensure transactions are properly loaded and
  stored with correct dates in the backend.

> Add specific log points to catch

● I will add log points inside get_paginated_transactions() to track the date filtering and query
  results.

● Update(backend/app/sql/account_logic.py)
  ⎿  Updated backend/app/sql/account_logic.py with 22 additions

● Log points have been added in the get_paginated_transactions() function to track input
  parameters, total count before filters, applied filters, and results count.
