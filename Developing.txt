  Accounts.vue officially can link new Plaid accounts again. Need to test Teller.
    Still to Implement:
      * Checking / Savings / Credit button toggles
      * Persist user modified fields in UpdateTransactionsTable.vue
      * Automatic Refresh of Accounts.vue page on Link Success

  Accounts.vue is looking rather clean. Routes completed for uploading an access token and saving account (Plaid)
  Checking / Savings / Credit button toggles do not work.
  Need to persist user modified fields in the UpdateTransactionsTable.vue

  - Teller looks to be building support for transfers

  - UI Elements need to work
    :NetYearComparisonChart
    :RecurringTransactionSection
    :NotificationsBar

* FOCUSPOINT *
  ==========
Looking to integrate functionality for UpdateTransactionsTable.vue component - for start, plan is likely to manually enter a Due Date & payment info. This should trigger an alert on the main dashboard that does not go away until a transaction matching the recurring match is logged for the payment period.


  ================== ^ Update ^
Cleaning up AccountsTable.vue buttons
  Integrate functionality for UpdateTransactionsTable.vue to persist user changes
  Adding routes and components for upload/download CSV
    * First finish the AccountsTable Cleanup
      - New upload download buttons will be in a dedicated component
    * Then build out download components and routes
    * Then build out upload components and routes

  Also Checking/Savings/Credit button toggles need to work but don't
