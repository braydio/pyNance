## Start of Task 

Reviewing flow from chart to account list logic, with target files:

- chart not loading usually due to missing user_id in plaid_helpers.py - traced to access_token structure
- full table model is confirmed and sharing user_id to accounts

- charts are deferred in loading if filteredTransactions is empty or not yet resolved
## Next step
Beginning analysis of view/Accounts.vue for display logic and user flow after sync.
