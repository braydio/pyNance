## Legacy Content (Preserved for Reference)

## General To-Do

- Add tests / checks / hooks to ensure the only CSS styling syntax is in-line with TailwindCSS

## Dashboard Page

- Header needs to be formatted, sized, centered, colored
- Snapshot feature is broken

# Spending by Category Chart

- Category Selection Menu
  - Needs to be moved off the main view, currently it obstructs half the visual
  - Should be a collapsible menu, or a typing field that auto-completes to selections
  - There are just too many different categories
  - Also, what granularity to display? General Category (Probably)? Detailed Category? Both? (I think not both. 'Shops > Computers & Electronics' looks messy)

# Transactions Table

- Does not currently render any transactions
- Review Visual Styling once Rendering

# Accounts Table

## Accounts Page

# Accounts Reorder Chart
