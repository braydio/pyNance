# Recent Transactions API

> Status: Archived (Merged)
> Planned Destination: `docs/backend/app/routes/transactions.md#recent-transactions-shortcut`
> Resolution: Details have been merged into the Transactions route documentation; this draft remains as an archived pointer.

This draft introduced the `recent=true` shortcut on `/api/transactions/<account_id>/transactions` for fetching the latest rows without pagination. The maintained documentation now lives in [Transactions Route](../backend/app/routes/transactions.md#recent-transactions-shortcut), including the sorting caveats for backfilled data.
