# Recurring Transactions Route

## Purpose

Handles detection, configuration, and tracking of recurring transactions such as subscriptions, rent, or utilities. Provides visibility into fixed financial obligations.

## Key Endpoints

- `GET /recurring`: Returns list of detected recurring transactions.
- `POST /recurring/confirm`: Confirms a transaction pattern as recurring.
- `DELETE /recurring/<id>`: Removes or disables tracking of a recurring item.
- `POST /recurring/scan/<account_id>`: Scan an account and store any newly detected recurring entries.

## Inputs & Outputs

  - **Output:**
    ```json

        "frequency": "monthly",
        "next_date": "2024-12-01"

## Known Behaviors

- Recurrence inferred from merchant + cadence heuristics
- User confirmation required before prediction affects forecasts
- Recurring entries appear in budget and forecast views
