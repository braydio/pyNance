# Arbitrage Route

## Purpose

Serve the latest R/S arbitrage signal generated by the Discord bot pipeline.
The route reads a JSON snapshot written to disk by background workers and
returns the result to the dashboard.

## Key Endpoints

- `GET /api/arbitrage/current` â€“ Load and return the contents of
  `ARBITRAGE_FILE`. If the file contains plain text it is wrapped as
  `{ "content": ... }`.

## Inputs & Outputs

- No request parameters are required.
- Responses return HTTP 200 with the parsed JSON payload or an empty `content`
  string when no file exists.

## Internal Dependencies

- `app.config.constants.ARBITRAGE_FILE`
- Standard library `json` and `os.path.exists`

## Known Behaviors

- Invalid JSON falls back to returning the raw file contents for easier
  debugging of the upstream writer.
