# config/ Directory

## Purpose

Houses all configuration logic used during application initialization. Includes environment-based settings, constants, and framework integrations. Centralizes control of runtime behavior for development, testing, and production environments.

## Files

- `__init__.py`
  - Marks this directory as a Python package

- `settings.py`
  - Main configuration loader
  - Reads from environment variables, `.env`, or config secrets
  - Defines:
    - `DATABASE_URL`
    - `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`
    - `JWT_SECRET`, `DEBUG`
    - Feature toggles, environment flags, Sentry keys

- `env.py`
  - Utility loader for `.env` parsing and variable substitution
  - May wrap `os.environ`, `dotenv`, or `pydantic` config

## Common Patterns

- `.getenv("FOO", fallback)` usage with type coercion
- Structured config classes (e.g., `class AppConfig`) with typed fields
- Environment isolation via `APP_ENV = dev|prod|test`

## Usage

- Imported by:
  - `main.py` to load Flask/FastAPI config
  - `services/` and `sql/` to get DB connection strings
  - CLI scripts to dynamically adjust logging or sync limits
