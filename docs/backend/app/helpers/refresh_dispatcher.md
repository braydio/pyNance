# Deprecated Refresh Dispatcher (Removed)

Legacy version of account refresh logic that duplicated
`account_refresh_dispatcher.py`.
All remaining callers have migrated, so this file has been deleted.

**Dependencies**: `app.models.Account`, `teller_helpers`, `plaid_helpers`,
`app.config.logger`.
```
