# Deprecated Refresh Dispatcher

Legacy version of account refresh logic. Duplicates
`account_refresh_dispatcher.py` and has been superseded by that module and the
new `sync_service`. Retained for reference but should be removed.

**Dependencies**: `app.models.Account`, `teller_helpers`, `plaid_helpers`,
`app.config.logger`.
