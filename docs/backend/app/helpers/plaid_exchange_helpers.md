# Plaid Token Exchange

Single function `exchange_public_token_for_product()` that wraps the Plaid
client to exchange a public token for an access token while tagging the product
being linked. Intended as a more explicit replacement for a helper in
`plaid_helpers`.

**Dependencies**: `plaid.Client`, local API key loader.
