# Stake Integration Cleanup Audit

## Overview

An audit was requested to identify any remaining code that supports the legacy
Stake brokerage integration.

## Backend API review

- Searched `backend/app/routes` and `backend/app/services` for any modules,
  blueprints, or functions referencing "stake".
- No Flask blueprints, FastAPI routers, or background tasks matching that name
  were found.
- Existing API documentation (`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`) also contains no Stake
  endpoints.

## Frontend review

- Scanned `frontend/src` (components, views, stores, and services) for strings
  or filenames containing "stake".
- No client-side API calls, routes, or UI components related to Stake are
  present.

## Conclusion

There is no Stake-specific code or API route in the current repository. No
changes are required beyond keeping this audit record for future reference.
