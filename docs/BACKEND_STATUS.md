## ðŸ”„ Forecast Engine Status â€“ June 6, 2025

### âœ… Current Status - Backend Modules

The backend now exposes live forecast endpoints (`GET /api/forecast`, `POST /api/forecast/calculate`) powered by `ForecastOrchestrator`. These routes aggregate `recurring_transactions` and `account_history` to return forecast and actual lines. Basic recurring detection persistence has been wired via `recurring_bridge.py`. Further work is required for advanced analytics and error handling.

### ðŸŒŸ Goals â€“ Next Development Phase

* Integrate `transactions`, `account_history`, and `recurring_transactions` into backend logic.
* Replace manual placeholders with live forecast + actual calculations.
* Implement delta analysis and proper error handling.
* Build out input validation and metadata population.
* Add backend tests for all forecast endpoints.
