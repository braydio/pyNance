## ðŸ”„ Forecast Engine Status â€“ May 10, 2025

### âœ… Current Status - Backend Modules

The backend is partially scaffolded with basic endpoint functionality (`/api/forecast`, `/api/forecast/calculate`) and mock logic for forecast vs actuals. Frontend structure, design, and module references are well-documented and chart rendering is prepped. However, the backend still lacks full integration with live financial data sources, forecast logic, and delta computations.

### ðŸŒŸ Goals â€“ Next Development Phase

* Integrate `transactions`, `account_history`, and `recurring_transactions` into backend logic.
* Replace manual placeholders with live forecast + actual calculations.
* Implement delta analysis and proper error handling.
* Build out input validation and metadata population.
* Add backend tests for all forecast endpoints.
