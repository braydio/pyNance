# Backend Status - Forecast Engine Development [BACKEND_STATUS]

This document tracks the current development status of backend modules, with primary focus on the forecast engine implementation and related system components.

## Forecast Engine Status - June 6, 2025 [FORECAST_STATUS]

### âœ… Current Status - Backend Modules

The backend now exposes live forecast endpoints (`GET /api/forecast`, `POST /api/forecast/calculate`) powered by `ForecastOrchestrator`. These routes aggregate `recurring_transactions` and `account_history` using SQL helpers `list_recurring_transactions` and `get_account_history_range` to return forecast and actual lines. Unit tests cover the JSON structure and invalid input cases. Basic recurring detection persistence has been wired via `recurring_bridge.py`. Further work is required for advanced analytics and error handling.

### ðŸŒŸ Goals â€“ Next Development Phase

* Integrate `transactions`, `account_history`, and `recurring_transactions` into backend logic.
* Replace manual placeholders with live forecast + actual calculations.
* Implement delta analysis and proper error handling.
* Build out input validation and metadata population.
* Add backend tests for all forecast endpoints.
