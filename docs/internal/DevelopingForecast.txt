# 📊 Forecast Graph Specification

## 🔁 1. Forecast Generation Logic

### Data Sources:

* Historical Transactions from Plaid
* Investment Performance from linked accounts
* Account Balances (for current net worth)
* User-entered manual income, expenses, and liabilities

### Forecast Model:

* Recurring income/expenses are projected forward based on user input or historical data patterns
* Investment returns factored in (e.g., monthly rate or compound yield)
* Liabilities (e.g., rent, debt payments) included per recurrence
* Forecasts extend to the end of the current view (month or year)
* Manual adjustments added via `ForecastAdjustmentsForm.vue`

## ✅ 2. Actuals Calculation

### Based On:

* Calculated from Plaid-linked account balances
* Represents net worth up to current date
* Driven by real-time or recently synced balance data
* Includes all transaction history and investment fluctuations

### Chart Behavior:

* Actuals line appears alongside Forecast
* Actuals only render up to today’s date (not future)
* Reflects sum of all known and realized financial positions

## 🗓 3. Static Date Range with Toggle

### View Modes:

* **Month View**

  * X-axis: Start of current month → End of current month
  * Granularity: daily or weekly
* **Year View**

  * X-axis: Jan 1st → Dec 31st of current year
  * Granularity: monthly

### Toggle Behavior:

* A button toggles between Month and Year
* View toggle affects:

  * X-axis range and label granularity
  * Forecast and Actuals datasets
  * Breakdown totals
  * Recurring forecast depreciation logic

## 🔢 4. Recurring Entry Handling (Deprecation Logic)

### Monthly Recurring:

* E.g., \$10/month

  * Month View: Pro-rated based on days left
  * Year View: \$10 \* number of months left in year

### Annual Recurring:

* E.g., \$120/year starting in June

  * Year View: Deprecate \$120 across remaining months (e.g., \$20/month)
  * Month View (June): Show relevant pro-rated portion if applicable

### Breakdown Totals:

* Totals dynamically update to reflect current view mode
* All manual or recurring items are deconstructed across the remaining time period

## 📈 5. Chart Rendering Features

* Two data series: Forecasted vs Actual
* Uses real calendar dates as x-axis (Month or Year scope)
* Forecast line continues through the full date range
* Actual line ends at today
* Tooltip on hover shows line values
* Toggle button visible in chart header
* Breakdown components update accordingly
