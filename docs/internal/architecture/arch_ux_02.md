# for arch_ux_02

## Start of Task 

Reviewing flow from chart to account list logic, with target files:

- chart not loading usually due to missing user_id in plaid_helpers.py - traced to access_token structure
- full table model is confirmed and sharing user_id to accounts

- charts are deferred in loading if filteredTransactions is empty or not yet resolved

## UX Refinment

- [X ] AccountsReorderChart.vue bug: chart renders before filtered data array is set
- [\] AssetsBarTrended.vue: added nextTick(), destroy on switch type, error handling 
- [] NET Year Comparison: refactored data toggles, safe error handling, debug support verified
