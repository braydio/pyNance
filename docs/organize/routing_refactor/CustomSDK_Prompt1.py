# I want a step by step analysis for each of those components with exposure to refactor logic. Review the contents of the exposed component. Identify the specific functions that will be exposed. Create a markdown formatted document, listing each exposed component its specific exposed functions, and its non-exposed functions. Do this iteratively for each file, for each function, until you have mapped every component. Write the list to Canvas. After mapping each component update your task log. Do not do anything else until this is complete.
