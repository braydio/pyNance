Below is what’s happening and how to resolve it.

## What’s going on

    1. **Your model defines `user_id` on `transactions`, but your DB schema does not.**
       In **models.py** you have:

           class Transaction(db.Model):
               __tablename__ = "transactions"
               id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
               user_id = db.Column(db.String(64), db.ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=True, index=True)
               transaction_id = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True, nullable=False)
               …

       [backend/app/models.py](/home/braydenchaffee/Projects/pyNance/backend/app/models.py)
    2. **Your initial Alembic migration never created that column.**
       In **backend/migrations/versions/0bc042573c3a_initial_prod_db.py** the `transactions` table is built without a `user_id` column:

           op.create_table('transactions',
               sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
               sa.Column('transaction_id', sa.String(length=64), nullable=False),
               sa.Column('account_id', sa.String(length=64), nullable=True),
               …
               sa.Column('pending', sa.Boolean(), nullable=True),
               sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id'),
               sa.UniqueConstraint('transaction_id')
           )

       [backend/migrations/versions/0bc042573c3a_initial_prod_db.py](/home/braydenchaffee/Projects/pyNance/backend/migrations/versions/0bc042573c3a_initial_

prod_db.py) 3. **SQLAlchemy is therefore trying to `SELECT transactions.user_id` against a SQLite table that doesn’t have it.**
For example, in your paginated‑transactions logic you do:

           query = (
               db.session.query(Transaction, Account)
               .join(Account, Transaction.account_id == Account.account_id)
               .order_by(Transaction.date.desc())
           )
           total = query.count()

       [backend/app/sql/account_logic.py](/home/braydenchaffee/Projects/pyNance/backend/app/sql/account_logic.py)

       Calling `.count()` on a multi‑entity query wraps the original select (including every column of `Transaction`, among them `user_id`) in a `SELECT

count(\*) FROM (…)`subquery. Since SQLite’s`transactions` table was created without that column, you get:

           sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: transactions.user_id

---

## Recommended fix

### 1) Keep the user_id field on Transaction and update your schema via Alembic

This is the most straightforward, especially if you plan to someday query or filter by transaction.user_id.

    # from your backend/ directory
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add user_id column to transactions"

Then review the new migration to ensure it contains something like:

    def upgrade():
        with op.batch_alter_table("transactions") as batch_op:
            batch_op.add_column(sa.Column("user_id", sa.String(length=64), nullable=True))
            batch_op.create_foreign_key(None, "users", ["user_id"], ["id"])
            batch_op.create_index("ix_transactions_user_id", ["user_id"], unique=False)

Finally apply it:

    alembic upgrade head

After that your SQLite transactions table will have the user_id column, and the error will go away.

### 2) (Alternative) Drop the user_id field if you don’t need it

If you’ve decided that every transaction’s owner can always be inferred from Account.user_id and you truly don’t need a separate transactions.user_id
column, then:

    1. Remove the `user_id = …` line from your `Transaction` model.
    2. Generate an Alembic migration to drop that column.
    3. (Optionally) adjust your query to explicitly select only the fields you care about—for example, use `.with_entities(...)` so SQLAlchemy doesn’t

implicitly SELECT a now‑nonexistent column.

---

### Why not just change the route logic?

While you could hack around it by changing your query (e.g. use .with_entities(...) or custom .count() to avoid selecting user_id), in the long run you want
your model definitions and your database schema to match. Keeping an Alembic migration in your history that brings the schema into alignment with your
model is the cleanest, most maintainable approach.

---

#### TL;DR

    * **Your code** expects `transactions.user_id` (because it’s in the model).
    * **Your DB** doesn’t have that column (migrations never created it).
    * **Fix**: add an Alembic migration to add `user_id` to `transactions`, then `alembic upgrade head`.

Let me know if you run into any issues with the migration!
