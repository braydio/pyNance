# Frontend Duplicate Component Review

This document tracks likely duplicated or unclear components for review and cleaning.

```text
Component | Role | Action
----------- |---------- |-------------------
@AccountsTable.vue | Std table | 最 Preserved, main version
@AccountsTableLite.vue  | Stubview partial copy | 开 likely placeholder - consider deleting
@LinkAccount.vue  | Account Link buttons  | 最 Refactored active file with content
@LinkAccountFullProducts.vue  | Empty file probably not used | 昋 Delete if unused
PRefreshControls.vue | Shared wrapper? | 最 Review for redendancy
RRefreshPlaidControls.vue | Plaid specific  | 最 Refactorer component?


UploadCSV.vue vs UploadDownloadCSV.vue | Sizes match, function may overlap | 最 Merge into one
```

## Updates

- ✅ `DailyNetTransactionsModal.vue` and `CategoryTransactionsModal.vue` have been replaced by direct usages of
  `TransactionModal.vue` in `Dashboard.vue`, eliminating the redundant wrapper components.

Likely obsolete:

- AccountsTableLite.vue (1-byte dommy file)
- LinkAccountFullProducts.vue (empty)
- backups/ (staging or deprecated)

Tasks:

1.  Grep for component usages:
    `grep -r "LinkAccountFullProducts" frontend/src``

2.  Merge URL and DownloadCSV files with similar size and flags;
    - Strong candidates by input token
    - Share styles and bland layout
