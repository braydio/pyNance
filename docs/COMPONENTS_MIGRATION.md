# Frontend Component Architecture and Migration Guide [COMPONENTS_MIGRATION]

This document defines a scalable, semantically organized, and maintainable folder structure for Vue components within the pyNance frontend application, aligned with project conventions and actual directory contents.

**Purpose:** Establish clear component organization patterns and migration pathways for improved maintainability and developer experience.

---

## ✅ Goals

- Establish clear subdirectory groupings for components
- Prevent UI bloat by separating concerns (layout, data views, widgets)
- Align with Tailwind design system and existing `/docs/`
- Support future growth with logical nesting and reuse patterns
- Reduce decision-making overhead for devs

## 📁 Proposed Directory Structure (Revised)

```

## 🔁 Classification Process (Updated)

1. **Inventory** all components recursively
2. Use naming + content inspection to determine:
   - Is it a UI primitive (goes to `base/`)?
   - Does it render a chart (goes to `charts/`)?
   - Is it a table with rows/data bindings (goes to `tables/`)?
   - Is it file/CSV/input-related (goes to `forms/`)?
   - Is it layout, modal, or fixed shell (goes to `layout/`)?
   - Is it a utility or dashboard display (goes to `widgets/`)?

---

## 🛠️ Next Developer Actions

- Move physical `.vue` files into the new folders
- Update all related imports
- Add `README.md` with a short purpose description for each subfolder
- Clean up any duplicated or unused legacy components

---

## 📌 Notes

- `base/` should contain only stateless utility-style components
- `charts/` may later include `BaseChart.vue` if it becomes reusable
- `forecast/` and `recurring/` should be reviewed and reclassified after inspection
- `ui/` is a placeholder for future purely visual subcomponents (badges, tags, etc.)

---

This is the canonical structure for Vue component organization in `pyNance` moving forward. All new and migrated components must adhere to this layout.
