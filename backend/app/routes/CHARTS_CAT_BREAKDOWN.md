# 📊 Category Breakdown Chart: Backend & Frontend Integration Analysis

## 🔍 Overview

This document outlines the logic, expectations, and issues encountered in rendering the **Category Breakdown Chart** in the frontend of the `pyNance` repository. It cross-validates the backend data flow and identifies improvement opportunities.

---

## 📁 Frontend Component: `CategoryChart.jsx`

**Path**: `frontend/src/components/charts/CategoryChart.jsx`

### 🔧 Purpose

This component is responsible for rendering a Pie or Doughnut chart representing categorized spending or income over a given period. It expects to receive processed data from the backend.

### 🔑 Key Logic

- Uses **`react-chartjs-2`** and **Chart.js** to render the data.
- Expects `categories` prop structured as:

```js
[
  { name: "Food", value: 120 },
  { name: "Transport", value: 45 },
]
```

- Fallback state: if `categories.length === 0`, chart renders no data.

### ⚠️ Observed Issues

- ❗ The `categories` prop is often **empty** due to no data fetch or broken backend integration.
- 📉 The component itself is correctly coded; the issue originates upstream.

## 🧠 Backend Endpoint: `/api/summary/categories`

### 📁 File

Route expected to serve data: `routes/summary.py` or similar in `app/routes/`

### 🔎 Expectations

- Endpoint should return JSON like:

```json
[
  { "category": "Food", "total": 120 },
  { "category": "Transport", "total": 45 }
]
```

### 🚨 Common Pitfalls

- Missing `user_id` in session or query.
- Date range not set or too narrow.
- SQL aggregation bug (e.g., wrong `GROUP BY`).
- Not returning in the expected frontend format (`name`, `value`).

---

## ✅ Validation Steps

1. **Backend Logs** show no error when category chart renders blank.
2. **Network Tab** shows 200 OK response but with empty payload `[]`.
3. ✅ Confirmed backend route is hit using a `fetch()` call from frontend.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- ✅ Validate `user_id` propagation from frontend to backend.
- ✅ Confirm query is filtering by the correct date range.
- ⚙️ Add a fallback in the component when no data is returned: "No data available."
- 🧪 Add unit test for the category summary endpoint (mock user + transactions).
- 📊 Consider caching or memoizing expensive aggregations.
