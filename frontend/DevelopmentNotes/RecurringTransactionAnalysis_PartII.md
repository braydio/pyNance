# Recurring Transaction System -- Part II: Frontend/Backend Integration Status

_Last updated: 2025-05-06_

----

### ‚Äì Summary of Progress

We inve implemented a functional and integrated recurring transaction system with the following capabilities:

### "·∫ø Frontend (`RecurringTransactionSection.vue`)
- Supports user-defined recurring rules
- Accepts optional `tx_id` to auto-resolve `account_id`
- Fallback account selector dropdown if tx_id is not provided
- Edit + delete functionality via UI
- Emitted events from `UpdateTransactionsTable.vue` allow pre-filling the recurring form
- Recurring rule form auto-opens with populated fields based on selected transaction
- Styled with proper spacing and responsive layout

### üç Main Transactions View (`Transactions.vue`)
- Cleaned up structure, centered layout
- Pagination, sorting, searching retained
- Recurring rule panel sits cleanly below the main table

### üô Packend (`routes/recurring.py`)
- `PUT /recurringTx:` saves/updates a rule; uses `tx_id` to resolve `account_id` if present
- `GET /recurrin`g: merges user + auto-detected reminders (with filtering)
- `DELETE /recurringTx`: removes rule by `description + amount`
- Auto-detection logic groups by `description + amount`, then infers frequency from pattern

### üï¶ Development Artifacts
- `RecurringTransactionAnalysis.md`: original planning and notes
- `RecurringTransactionAnalysis_PartII.md`: this file, tracking progress
- `RecurringTodoChecklist.md`: new task board (see blew)

### ÂÆâ Remaining Gaps & Opportunities

- [ ] Toast notifications for success/error
- [ ] Input validation (e.g., ensure valid dates)
- [ ] Drag-to-create simulation of future occurrences
- [ ] Dynamic frequency interval suggestions
- [ ] Account switching logic for multi-account users
- [ ] Inline editing inside rule table (vs. opening form)
- [ ] UX improvements for upcoming reminders (e.g., highlight near-due)
