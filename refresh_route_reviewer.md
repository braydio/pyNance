#### 📌 Checklist Overview

- [x] Mapped core files in `helpers/`, `sql/`, and `routes/`
- [x] Parsed `account_refresh_dispatcher.py` — sync orchestration confirmed, `user_id` not threaded
- [x] Parsed `plaid_helpers.py` — `AccountHistory` update confirmed, `user_id` inferred
- [x] Parsed `teller_helpers.py` — sync parity validated, explicit `user_id` usage
- [x] Reviewed `refresh_dispatcher.py` — confirmed redundant
- [x] Initiated user_id threading task group
- [ ] Modify sync helpers to accept and pass `user_id`

#### 🕵️ File Reviews

**account_refresh_dispatcher.py**
- Sync routing logic confirmed for Teller/Plaid
- `refresh_all_accounts()` is cron-friendly, calls per account
- No explicit `user_id` threading — inferred via `Account`

**plaid_helpers.py**
- Balance data saved via `update_account_history()`
- `user_id` is inferred, not passed
- Logging + context present, but not full test wrapping

**teller_helpers.py**
- Syncs use `user_id` explicitly
- Data is written to `AccountHistory` cleanly
- Parity with Plaid achieved

**refresh_dispatcher.py**
- Redundant with `account_refresh_dispatcher.py`
- No distinct functionality; archive/delete safe if unused

#### ⏭️ Next
- Patch: add `user_id` param to `sync_teller_account()` + `sync_plaid_account()`
- Refactor `update_account_history()` calls to take explicit `user_id`
- Log `user_id` use at sync-time
- Begin stub tests for sync flow injection
