#### 📌 Checklist Overview

- [x] Mapped core files in `helpers/`, `sql/`, and `routes/`
- [x] Parsed `account_refresh_dispatcher.py` — sync orchestration confirmed, `user_id` not threaded
- [x] Parsed `plaid_helpers.py` — `AccountHistory` update confirmed, `user_id` inferred
- [x] Parsed `teller_helpers.py` — sync parity validated, explicit `user_id` usage
- [x] Reviewed `refresh_dispatcher.py` — confirmed redundant
- [x] Initiated user_id threading task group
- [x] Created `sync_service.py` for unified sync interface
- [ ] Refactor dispatcher to use sync service

#### 🕵️ File Reviews

**account_refresh_dispatcher.py**

- Sync routing logic confirmed for Teller/Plaid
- `refresh_all_accounts()` is cron-friendly, calls per account
- No explicit `user_id` threading — inferred via `Account`

**plaid_helpers.py**

- Balance data saved via `update_account_history()`
- `user_id` is inferred, not passed
- Logging + context present, but not full test wrapping

**teller_helpers.py**

- Syncs use `user_id` explicitly
- Data is written to `AccountHistory` cleanly
- Parity with Plaid achieved

**sync_service.py**

- New abstraction for provider-aware sync calls
- Centralizes logging and error handling
- Future candidate for test harness entry

#### ⏭️ Next

- Refactor dispatcher to use `sync_account()` from `sync_service`
- Begin unit tests for `sync_service.sync_account()` behavior by provider
