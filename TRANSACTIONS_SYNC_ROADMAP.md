# ðŸš€ Roadmap: Plaid Transactions Sync Migration

## 1. Overview

Move pyNance from Plaid's legacy `transactions/get` flow to the delta-based `transactions/sync` API. The new model persists a per-item cursor and applies added/modified/removed transactions, eliminating redundant fetches and webhook complexity.

## 2. Current State

### Implemented

- Data model â€“ `PlaidAccount.sync_cursor` present and used to persist cursors.
- Plaid sync service â€“ `app/services/plaid_sync.py` implements `/transactions/sync` with paging and atomic upserts/deletes; persists `next_cursor` and updates `last_refreshed`.
- Flask endpoint â€“ `POST /api/plaid/transactions/sync` accepts `{ account_id }` and invokes the sync service.
- Legacy fetch â€“ Still available via `refresh_accounts` for adâ€‘hoc range pulls during migration.

### Missing

- Plaid webhooks â€“ add `/api/webhooks/plaid` for `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` to trigger account/item syncs.
- Teller sync parity â€“ optional; Teller doesnâ€™t provide a cursored sync API, but we can align naming.
- Tests & monitoring â€“ add unit tests for service logic and route, and basic metrics logs.

## 3. Migration Plan

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure Plaid SDK â‰¥9.4.0 is installed.

2. **Data Model**
   - Confirm `PlaidAccount.sync_cursor` is migrated and indexed.
   - Add `plaid_item_cursor` table if account-scoped cursors prove insufficient.

3. **Sync Service**
   - Implemented in `app/services/plaid_sync.py` (paging, atomic apply, cursor persistence).
   - Exposed via `POST /api/plaid/transactions/sync`.

4. **Webhook Handler**
   - TODO: add `/api/webhooks/plaid` handler to receive `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` and invoke sync for impacted accounts/items.

5. **Onboarding Strategy**
   - For each existing item, choose: full historical sync (empty cursor) or fast-forward (`cursor="now"`).
   - Record migration choice in ops log.

6. **Cutover**
   - Feature flag items as they migrate (cursor presence can be the flag).
   - Disable scheduled `transactions/get` jobs for items once cursor is set and first sync completes.

7. **Decommission Legacy**
   - Remove `transactions/get` helper and related webhooks once all items use Sync.
   - Retain `/transactions/refresh` only for on-demand refresh UI.

## 4. Completion Metrics

- âœ… `plaid.sync_transactions` handles paging, mutations, and stores `next_cursor`.
- âœ… Webhook endpoint processes `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` and triggers sync.
- âœ… Tests cover sync flow, webhook handler, and cursor persistence.
- âœ… Legacy `transactions/get` paths removed and all items have recorded cursors.
