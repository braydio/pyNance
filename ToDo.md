## Dashboard.vue

### Components

- `Title & Greeting`
  - Update styling to be in line with expected title & greeting

  - The custom message on the third row should update based on the total net worth of the user
    - Below $0 shows concerned message
    - Above $1,000 shows encouraging message etc.
    - Message should be amusing, sarcastic, humorous, even insulting
- `Account Snapshot`
  - Theme the Account Snapshot title to demonstrate it is a distinct module/section
  - The 'configure' button should be themed to match design
  - The submenu (Select up to 5 accounts) should be themed as a dropdown
  - The configuration button should be a fuzzyfind supported dropdown menu selection
  - Currently it does not display anything. This broken module needs to be fixed and styled per above

- `Daily Net Income Chart`
  - This chart currently does not display any information and needs to be fixed
  - The axis labels are too small and are difficult to read
